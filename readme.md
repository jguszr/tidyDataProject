## Basic Definitions :

* version :   3.3.1 (2016-06-21)
* R Studio : 0.99.903 (darwin13.4.0 )

### Expected behaviour
* The ``run_analysis.R`` script must download, extract and handle on it own all operations that leads to the creation of a output file named : ``tidyData.txt`` 
* Dependencies are loaded by the script as *required*
* output files will be saved locally on the current working directory.
